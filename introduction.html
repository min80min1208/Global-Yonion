    <h1>WHO ARE WE? ðŸ¤”</h1>
    
        <p>Hello, we are Global Yondae, a team participating in IHEI Yonsei.</p>
        <p>Global Yonion is our service, which connects especially the exchange students to provide information about exchanging countries and sell&buy used items. </p>
        <p>For those who should buy their daily necessities since they could not bring those items from their home because of the items' huge size&volume, we established this "GLOBAL YONION" platform. </p>
        <p> We pursue recycling and buying used items for our better future. Thus, if you want to get necesities used by another exchange students for up to a year at a cheap price, make sure to use GLOBAL YONION! ðŸ™Œ </p>
